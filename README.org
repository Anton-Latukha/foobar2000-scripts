Use:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
paste -s file | awk '{$2=$2};1'
#+END_SRC
To merge lines from file into one superstring.

Ready example presets are in the =shell= scripts.

Suggestions:
1) If tracks on CD have different peaks - that means that disc is probably done from the master tape.
2) The longer the master tape was laying around - the worse it gets, the less dynamic range it has.
3) Generally the older CDs have better mastering, and acoustic master tape source was in better quality.
